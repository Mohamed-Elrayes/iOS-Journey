# iOS Journey

Welcome to my iOS Learning Hub! This repository is where I'll be documenting everything I learn as I dive into iOS development.

## Resources

To guide my learning journey, I will be using the following resources:

- **Books by AppCoda**: AppCoda offers comprehensive guides and tutorials on iOS development, perfect for both beginners and intermediate learners.
  
- **Stanford CS193p**: This is the well-known iOS Development course offered by Stanford University. It provides a deep dive into iOS app development using Swift.

## Project Structure

I'll be organizing this repository into the following sections:

1. **Notes**: Detailed notes and explanations from the resources I'm studying.
2. **Examples**: Code examples and small projects based on what I'm learning.
3. **Challenges**: Challenges and exercises to test my understanding.
4. **Projects**: Larger projects where I apply what I've learned to build complete iOS applications.

## Goals

- Gain a solid understanding of Swift and iOS development.
- Complete the AppCoda books and Stanford CS193p course.
- Build a portfolio of iOS projects.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore the repository. If you're also learning iOS development, you might find the notes and examples helpful. I'm open to suggestions and feedback, so don't hesitate to reach out if you have any!
