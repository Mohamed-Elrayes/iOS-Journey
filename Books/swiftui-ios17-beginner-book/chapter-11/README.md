## Summary

In this chapter, we explored the concept of navigation views in iOS apps, which provide a drill-down interface for presenting hierarchical content. We integrated navigation views into our FoodPin project, demonstrating how to create a sophisticated user interface using a combination of navigation views and list views. We also covered how to add a restaurant detail view, navigate between views, customize the navigation bar, and remove disclosure indicators.

## Key Highlights

- Navigation views allow for hierarchical content presentation.
- Integration of `NavigationStack` with `List` for navigation.
- Customization of navigation bar appearance and behavior.
- Implementation of detail views using `ZStack` for layered UI elements.
- Customization of the back button and removal of disclosure indicators.
