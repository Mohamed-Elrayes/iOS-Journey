## Exercise

The demo app displays the same image for all table cells. Try to tweak the app such that it shows a different image in each cell (hint: Create another array for the images). You can download the image pack from http://www.appcoda.com/resources/swift4/simpletable-images-2.zip. Figure 8-19 shows the resulting screen.
