## Exercise

Your task is to modify the existing code and build a "Guess These Movies" app. The UI and functions are very similar to the Hello World app. Each button displays a set of emoji icons. The player's task is to guess the movie's name from those emojis. By tapping the button, the app will speak out the correct answer. For example, when the player taps the button in blue, the app reads "The answer is Ocean 11!"
