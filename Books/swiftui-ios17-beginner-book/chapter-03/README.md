# iOS Development with Swift and SwiftUI

## Chapter 3: Build Your First App in Swift and SwiftUI

### Overview

In this chapter, you will begin your journey into iOS app development by building your first app using Swift and SwiftUI. This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of the SwiftUI framework and provides hands-on experience in creating a simple yet functional app.

### Key Concepts

- **SwiftUI Framework:** Understand the basics of SwiftUI, Apple's modern framework for building user interfaces across all platforms using declarative programming.
- **Declarative Programming:** Learn how SwiftUI allows you to describe your UI in code, making it more intuitive and less error-prone compared to imperative programming.
- **Xcode Basics:** Get familiar with Xcode, Apple's integrated development environment (IDE), and learn how to navigate its features to build and preview your app.
- **UI Components:** Explore the primary building blocks of SwiftUI, including `Text`, `Image`, and `Button`.

## Exercise

Your task is to modify the existing code and build a "Guess These Movies" app. The UI and functions are very similar to the Hello World app. Each button displays a set of emoji icons. The player's task is to guess the movie's name from those emojis. By tapping the button, the app will speak out the correct answer. For example, when the player taps the button in blue, the app reads "The answer is Ocean 11!"
