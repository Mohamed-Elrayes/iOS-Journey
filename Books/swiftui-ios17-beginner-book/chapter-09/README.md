# Beginning iOS Programming with Swift and SwiftUI

## Chapter 9: Understanding Struct, Project Organization, and Code Documentation

## Summary

In this chapter, we delve into the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), focusing on structures (structs) and classes in Swift. The chapter explains how OOP allows us to break down complex software into smaller, manageable pieces, and it introduces key concepts such as properties, functionalities, methods, classes, and structures. The chapter also compares value types (structs) and reference types (classes) in Swift, providing practical examples to illustrate the differences. Finally, the chapter revisits the FoodPin project to demonstrate how to apply these OOP concepts by creating a `Restaurant` struct.

## Key Highlights

- Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Explanation of structs and classes in Swift
- Differences between value types (structs) and reference types (classes)
- Use of the `self` keyword in Swift
- Application of OOP concepts in the FoodPin project by creating a `Restaurant` struct
