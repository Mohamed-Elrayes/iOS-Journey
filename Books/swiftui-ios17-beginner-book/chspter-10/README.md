## Summary

In this chapter, the focus is on handling row deletion in a list view, implementing swipe actions, adding context menus, and integrating an activity controller for sharing features. The chapter guides the reader through the process of adding a swipe-to-delete feature, creating custom swipe actions, presenting context menus, and using the UIActivityViewController to enable social sharing within the app.

## Key Highlights
