## Basic Concepts

### Variables and Constants

- **Variables**: Use `var` to declare variables that can change.
- **Constants**: Use `let` to declare constants that cannot be modified once set.

### Data Types

- Common data types include `Int`, `Double`, `String`, and `Bool`.

### Type Inference

- Swift infers the type of a variable from its initial value, though explicit type declaration is also possible.

### Conditional Statements

- **`if` Statement**
- **`switch` Statement**
- **`Collections and Optionals` Statement**

This chapter covers fundamental Swift concepts such as variables, control flow, collections, and optionals, providing a solid foundation for programming in Swift.
